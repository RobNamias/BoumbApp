# SuperSaw Synth Patch

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
SuperSaw synth patches typically feature **straight 16th-note patterns** with no inherent syncopation or swing, as they emphasize sustained chords or monophonic melodies in EDM/trance contexts for rhythmic stability[1][3][4][5].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**No specific scales** are defined for SuperSaw patches; they use standard chromatic or diatonic chord progressions (e.g., triads played polyphonically) with sawtooth waves detuned across 7+ unison voices for dense harmonics[1][3][5].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **SuperSaw Synth**: Lead role; **sustained whole or half notes** (stacked detuned saw waves, 7+ oscillators, unison detune ±10-20 cents); no percussive patterns[1][2][3][5].
- **Kick/Snare/Bass**: Not part of the patch; SuperSaw overlays mid-range frequencies above sub-bass (avoid chord mud with bass); pair with 4-on-the-floor kick (quarter notes) and snare on beats 2/4 in trance/EDM[4][6].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Medium dynamic range** (velocity 80-127 mapped to amplitude); subtle LFO modulation on pitch/detune (slow rates <1Hz) for organic drift, avoiding sharp attacks; filter envelopes open gradually (attack 100-500ms) for sustained swells[1][2][3].
