# Pluck Synth Sound Design

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Pluck synth patterns emphasize **short, staccato 16th-note bursts** with minimal sustain for punchy attacks. No explicit syncopation or swing in core design; patterns align to straight grid (e.g., off-beat 16th-note stabs on beats 2 and 4).[1][3] Typical sequencer phrasing: repeat every 1/4 note subdivided into 4x 16th notes, decay within first two 16ths per note.[1]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Uses **harmonic-rich waveforms** (e.g., sawtooth or wavetables with dense overtones) tuned to major or minor scales common in pop/EDM (e.g., C minor: C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭; intervals 1-½-1½-1-1½-1½-1). Unison detuning (5-7 voices) spreads intervals by ±5-10 cents for width; filter envelope sweeps cutoff from high to low (LPF, resonance 20-40%) exposing lower harmonics over time.[2][3]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns
- **Kick**: Supports pluck with 4-on-the-floor (quarter-note hits); pluck avoids low-end clash via HPF scoop (below 150Hz).[3]
- **Snare/Claps**: Syncs to backbeat (beats 2/4); pluck stabs fill 16th-note gaps between snare, e.g., 8th-note triplet feel avoided for straight rhythm.
- **Bass**: Sub-bass (sine wave, 40-60Hz) holds root notes on beat 1; pluck occupies mid-range (400-2kHz) with short decays to prevent masking.
Pluck role: **lead melody/chord stabs** in 16th-note patterns (e.g., two 16ths on, two off per beat), panned stereo for movement.[1][2][3]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Fast attack** (5-15ms) to 0 sustain, **short decay** (50-200ms), minimal release (20-50ms) for plucky envelope. Velocity maps to high-frequency emphasis (harder hits boost highs via filter/amp); dynamic range 60-127 MIDI velocity, with 80-110 peak for mix punch, low velocities (40-70) for subtle tails.[1][2][3]
