# Acid 303 Slide & Accent

Acid 303 Slide & Accent is defined primarily by 16th‑note TB‑303 sequencing with *slides* (legato pitch glides between adjacent steps) and *accents* (per‑step changes that raise filter cutoff, shorten envelope and increase amplitude), producing squelchy, dynamic basslines that move under the groove[1][3]. 

1) Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
- Core grid: patterns are typically programmed as 16 steps at 16th‑note resolution; slides and accents are applied per step so the minimal rhythmic unit is a 16th note[3].  
- Syncopation: tonal and rhythmic interest comes from resting or tying (continuation) of steps and placing accented steps off the downbeat (e.g., accents on the 2e or 3& 16ths) to imply syncopation while the sequencer still runs on strict 16th timing[3].  
- Swing: typical acid lines are played with little to no mechanical swing on the 16th grid; swing can be introduced by delaying every other 16th (e.g., 8th‑note triplet timing) but classic TB‑303 patterns rely more on slide/legato timing than shuffle swing for groove[3][4].  

2) Harmony & Scales
- Scale choice: common pitch contents are minor natural (Aeolian), Dorian, and minor pentatonic/modal scalar fragments emphasizing root‑and‑fifth motion; chromatic approach tones and short scalar runs are used for tension[1][3].  
- Intervals and motion: emphasis on small intervals (minor/major 2nds, minor 3rds, perfect 4ths/5ths) so slides create audible pitch glide between adjacent scale degrees; repeated accented steps often create rising filter/energy contours[2][3].  
- Functional harmony: patterns are usually ostinato single‑voice lines (bass/lead) rather than chordal harmony; implied harmonic movement is achieved by changing the root step or transposing 303 patterns across bars[3].  

3) Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- Bass (TB‑303 role): mono, resonant low‑mid lead with programmable accent and slide per step; patterns are single‑note sequences with slides connecting steps flagged as “slide/legato” and accents raising filter/env on flagged steps[3][1].  
- Kick: straight 4/4 four‑to‑the‑floor 16th‑aligned pattern (kick on 1, 1e/1&, etc. often just on beats 1,2,3,4) to anchor the 16th grid; typical kick pattern is steady on the quarter‑note pulses, allowing 303 motion to occupy the subdivisions[4].  
- Snare/clap: placed on 2 and 4 (backbeat) or replaced with sparse off‑beat claps; in acid techno/house the snare may be minimal or substituted by mid/high percussion so the 303 occupies the midrange[4].  
- Hi‑hat/percussion: 16th hi‑hat patterns (closed hats on 16ths, open hats on off‑beats) provide higher‑frequency rhythmic detail; syncopated percussion combinations interact with 303 accents for perceived groove[4].  
- Patterns summary (16th note phrasing): program 16 steps; mark slides between adjacent scale degrees you want to glide; place accents on steps you want brighter/shorter/louder; use rests/ties to create syncopation while keeping the sequencer locked to 16th timing[3][1].  

4) Velocity / Dynamic Range
- TB‑303 internal accent is not a MIDI velocity but functions as a per‑step dynamic control that increases amplitude, raises filter cutoff and shortens envelope—perceptually roughly +6–+12 dB on accented steps versus unaccented, depending on device/cloning behavior[3][2].  
- External dynamics: when sequencing 303 clones in DAWs, map accented steps to higher velocity values; recommended velocity range for accented steps ≈ 90–127 and unaccented ≈ 40–80 (MIDI 0–127) to reproduce the perceived loudness and brightness contrast.  
- Microdynamics: because the 303’s accent circuit also changes filter and envelope timing, perceived dynamics are larger than pure amplitude change; program clustered accents (repeated accented steps) to exploit the accent sweep behavior that produces rising timbral intensity[2][3].  

Practical sequencing recipe (for a DAW/sequencer):
- Use a 16‑step loop at 16th‑note resolution; set tempo appropriate to style.  
- Choose a minor/ modal scale (e.g., A minor / A Dorian) and restrict notes to adjacent scale degrees for smooth slides.  
- Mark slides on contiguous steps you want to glide between (do not use slide where you want discrete retriggered notes)[3].  
- Flag accents on 1–4 steps per bar to create peaks; map accent to MIDI velocity or a dedicated accent CC, and map another CC to emulate 303 accent‑to‑filter amount if your synth supports it[3][2].  
- Keep the kick steady on quarter notes; place snare/clap on 2 and 4 or use sparse percussion to avoid masking the 303’s midrange[4].
