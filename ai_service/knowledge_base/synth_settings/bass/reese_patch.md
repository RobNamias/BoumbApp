# Reese Patch

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Reese Patch basslines are sustained legato layers filling entire bars (e.g., 16th-note overlaps at 174 BPM), with no rearticulation per note for smooth wobble. No syncopation or swing specified; rhythmic groove derives from track breaks in drum & bass/jungle (e.g., 122-174 BPM straight 16ths).[1][2][3]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Typically monophonic, outlining chord changes in scales like **B minor** (e.g., notes defining harmony in drops). Uses sine/triangle waves or detuned saws; no complex polyphony—single-note lines with overlapping legato for patch motion.[2][3][4]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Bass (Reese Patch)**: Core element—detuned oscillators (e.g., sin-tri, saws) with unison for wobble, low-pass filter (~650 Hz cutoff, 14% res), distortion/saturation, mono mode. Patterns: sustained 16th-note legato holds (full bars), melodic motion outlining scale degrees.[1][2][3][4][5]
- **Kick/Snare**: Not defining for Reese; supports via frenetic drum breaks (jungle/DnB). Reese anchors low-end rhythmically against these—no specific kick/snare patterns tied to patch.[1][2]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Sustained/legato play implies low velocity variation (60-80 range for evenness); dynamics from modulation (LFO/unison detune) and distortion rather than note velocity. Full-bar holds maintain consistent mid-low output without peaks/dips.[2][4]
