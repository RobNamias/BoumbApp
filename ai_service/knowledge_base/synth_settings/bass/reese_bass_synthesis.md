# Reese Bass Synthesis

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Reese Bass aligns with **jungle/drum & bass grooves** at **160-180 BPM**, using **16th-note patterns** with syncopation on off-beats (e.g., beats 2, 4, 10, 14 in a 16th grid) for driving pulse. No inherent swing; **straight timing** with LFO-modulated filter wobble (0.25-1 Hz rate) creates rhythmic evolution, syncing to 16th-note divisions for subtle phasing[1][2][3][4].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**No fixed scale**; typically **root-fifth-octave** intervals (e.g., C2-G2-C3) or single sustained roots in **minor pentatonic** (C Eb F G Bb) or **mixolydian** (C D E F G A Bb) for harmonic richness. Detuned sawtooths (+/-5-15 cents) generate **harmonic overtones** (intervals: unison, octave, fifth, fourth) via phase cancellation, avoiding complex progressions[1][2][5].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Amen-style breakbeats; **16th-note hi-hat syncopation** under Reese, punchy 808 at root frequency (30-60 Hz).
- **Snare**: Layered claps on 2/4 with ghosted 16th-note fills; velocity-accented for snap.
- **Bass (Reese)**: **Sustained 1-2 bar holds** on root notes, **16th-note filter LFO sweeps** (low-pass cutoff 100-300 Hz modulated triangle wave); detuned sawtooths (2-4 osc, unison detune), distortion for mids (200-500 Hz). Pattern: quarter-note onsets with 16th-note wobble decay[1][2][3][4].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Narrow range: 80-110** (mid-high velocity) for consistent punch; subtle **LFO-driven amplitude modulation** (depth 10-20%) simulates dynamics. Compression (4:1 ratio, fast attack) evens output; distortion adds perceived energy without velocity peaks[2][4].
