# Hi-Hats Rolls

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Hi-hat rolls consist of rapid **16th-note or 32nd-note bursts** (repeating the same note at 32nds or faster), typically placed at the **end of a bar** for transitions or **before a snare** to build anticipation.[3][7]  
Use **syncopation** by placing rolls on offbeats (e.g., "and" of beat 2 in 16th-note grid) for tension.[4]  
Apply **minimal swing** (5-15%) to mimic human feel; avoid grid-perfect timing—offset notes slightly off-grid for groove.[5]  
Standard pattern: Steady 8th or 16th notes as base, with rolls filling gaps in kick/snare (e.g., 1-&-a-2-&-a-3-&-a-4-&-a).[2][4]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
No harmonic content; hi-hat rolls are **percussive fills** without scales or intervals.[1][2]  
Optional: Pitch bends in **C2-C3 range** (lower octaves) for snare-like accents in rolls, avoiding mud below C2.[2]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Hi-Hats**: Core instrument—**closed** for crisp 16th-note rolls (tight sound); **open** sparingly (e.g., end of roll) for release; **half-open** for barking effect.[1][4]  
  Pattern: 16th-note triplets or 32nd-note bursts (4-8 hits), e.g., on beats 4-&-a in 4/4.[3][7]  
- **Kick**: On downbeats (1, 3); rolls fill spaces between kicks without overlap.[4][7]  
- **Snare**: Backbeats (2, 4); rolls build to snare hit; optional snare rolls with increasing velocity.[4]  
- **Bass**: No direct role; hi-hat rolls add momentum over bass groove.[4]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**60-120 range** (MIDI scale); start rolls at **low velocity (60-80)**, crescendo to **peak (100-120)** or decrescendo for natural drummer feel.[3][4]  
Vary per note: **Humanize** with ±10-20 variation; higher velocity on open hats for intensity.[1][3]  
Closed hats: Consistent **70-90**; rolls decrease/increase gradually to avoid robotic sound.[3]
