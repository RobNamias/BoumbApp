# String Arrangement MIDI

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
String MIDI arrangements prioritize **straight 16th-note rhythms** in ostinatos for tension-building, using staccatissimo or spiccato articulations on equal-length notes (e.g., alternating 8th-notes with up/down bows).[2][3]  
No inherent **swing**; grooves follow track tempo with subtle timing variations across sections (violins, violas) for realism, avoiding block chords—use independent melodic lines with detached passages on offbeats for syncopation.[1][6]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Diatonic major/minor scales** (e.g., simple triads like D, Eb, A) with voice leading: move 1-2 voices per chord change for smooth transitions, creating micro-dissonances that resolve quickly.[4][5]  
Unisons across octaves (e.g., motif on violin/cello) for power; avoid cramped voicings—distribute notes (violins high melody, cellos bass).[1][4]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
No percussion (kick/snare) in pure string MIDI—focus on **string sections**: Violins (high melody, 16th-note ostinatos), Violas (mid harmony fills), Cellos (bass notes/power), Double Bass (low root support).[4][5]  
Patterns: Legato sustains (whole notes), staccato 8th/16th-note repeats, pizzicato bass lines (plucked 1/4-notes syncing with track bass).[2][6] Write each line separately for independent movement.

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Wide velocity range (20-127)**: Low velocities (20-60) for pp pianissimo (slow attack/release, minimal vibrato); high (100-127) for ff fortissimo (fast attack, high harmonics).[3]  
Automate CC11 (expression) and vibrato intensity; scale envelope inversely to velocity for realism—staccato at soft levels, legato swells at loud.[3][5] Use keyswitches for articulation shifts (e.g., staccato to sustain).[2]
