Piano House Chords: concise technical profile.

Rhythm & Groove (16th-note grid — syncopation, swing)
- Core placement: chords usually land on the quarter-note pulse (1, 2, 3, 4) with additional chord stabs and fills placed on 16th-note subdivisions to create bounce and motion.  
- Syncopation pattern example (16th-grid): typical “piano-house” stab pattern = chord on 1.00, short stabs on 1.75 (the “& a” of 1), 2.50 (the “&” of 2), 3.25 (the “e” of 3), 4.00 (downbeat) — i.e., emphasis on off‑downbeat 16ths to produce forward momentum.[4][1]  
- Common two-handed groove: right‑hand rhythmic stabs across 16ths while left‑hand plays sustained chord tones or bassline on downbeats and selected 16ths for syncopation (copy lowest chord note into bass, placed on 1.00 and occasional 16th offsets).[4]  
- Swing: light-to-moderate swing (triplet feel applied to 16th pairs) is optional; classic/Chicago-derived piano house usually uses minimal swing (straight 16ths) while some modern variants add 54–62% swing to delay every second 16th in a pair for a laid-back groove.[4][3]  
- Accent/lift technique: move certain chord hits earlier by 1–3 16th ticks (pre‑delay) or later by 1–3 ticks to create push/pull micro‑grooves; typical recipe: move the 4th chord in a bar 1–3 ticks early to create anticipation.[4]

Harmony & Scales (interval content and common chord types)
- Scale choices: major (Ionian) and natural minor (Aeolian) are most common; modal flavors (Dorian, Mixolydian) appear for soulful/club variations.[1][2]  
- Chord types: triads with added color—major, minor, dominant 7th, major7, minor7, and 9ths/11ths/13ths (extensions used sparingly to thicken sound). Extended chords (7/9/11) are common for “house” color without altering root motion.[4][5]  
- Typical progressions: pop/house staples— I–V–vi–IV, vi–IV–I–V, vi–IV–V–I, vi–ii–IV–V; 4–8 bar cycles with repetition and inversion changes every 4 bars.[2][1]  
- Voice-leading/inversions: frequent use of first/second inversions and keeping common tones between chords to smooth motion (e.g., keep E in place while bass moves). Left‑hand root doubling or dropped‑octave bass reinforces the chord root.[4][6]  
- Intervals emphasized: major/minor thirds and perfect fifths for core triad; added 7ths or 9ths placed in upper voices (right hand) to avoid low‑end muddiness.[5]

Typical Instruments & Patterns (roles: Kick, Snare, Bass, Piano, Pads)
- Kick (role & pattern): four-on-the-floor kick on every quarter (1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00); tight 60–120 ms decay for dance clarity; sidechain compression envelope commonly applied to chord buses synchronized to kick (ducking on each quarter) to make piano chords pump with the groove.[4][2]  
- Snare/Clap: clap or snare on the 2 and 4 (backbeat); layered clap + short reverb snap for brighter piano house. Ghost 16th claps or rimshots may appear on off‑16ths for groove texture.  
- Bass (role & pattern): electric/synth bass or sampled sub; plays root motion and simple melodic steps (often on 8th or syncopated 16ths). Common patterns: root on downbeat then step on the “&” (2.50/4.50) or on a 16th offset to lock with piano stabs; bass often uses octave jumps and passing 16th runs to connect chord roots.[2][4]  
- Piano (role & pattern): primary harmonic and rhythmic instrument—right hand supplies stabs and chordal riffs (short 16th staccato or 32–64 ms note lengths), left hand doubles root or plays arpeggiated 16th patterns; typical programming: chord slices on quarter notes with additional 16th stabs and 16th‑note arpeggio fills.[4][3]  
- Pads/Strings: long sustained pads or airy strings hold chord tones (low velocity) on whole bars to add sustain and fill spectrum between piano attacks.  
- High percussion/hi-hats: closed hi-hats on 8ths or off‑beat 16ths, open hat on “&” of 2 and 4; 16th‑note hat rolls with velocity variation for propulsion.  
- Arrangement practice: repeat a chord pattern for 4–8 bars, then vary voicing/inversion or add a suspended/added‑note chord on bar 4 for movement.[2][4]

Velocity / Dynamic Range (MIDI velocity & mixing behavior)
- MIDI velocity ranges: piano stabs commonly programmed between velocity 80–120 (MIDI 0–127 scale) for presence; softer background chords/pads at 30–70. Left‑hand bass/root notes often at velocity 100–127 for weight, with occasional lower velocities for ghosting.[4][3]  
- Velocity layering: use multiple velocity layers for sampled acoustic piano to change timbre—low velocity = darker felt tone; high velocity = bright attack; map staccato samples to >90 velocity for punchy stabs.  
- Dynamic shaping: apply short ADSR sustain for staccato stabs (decay 50–200 ms) and longer sustain for pad/lift chords; velocity-to-filter/EQ modulation recommended—higher velocity increases high-frequency content and brightness.  
- Recommended mixing headroom: keep piano stabs 2–6 dB below lead vocal/melody but above pads; use sidechain depth tied to kick to create perceived dynamic movement rather than raw level changes.[4]  
- Micro-dynamics: use small velocity differences (±6–12 MIDI units) across repeated 16th stabs to avoid machine‑gun sameness; accent downbeat stabs by +8–16 MIDI units relative to surrounding hits.

Practical sequencer recipes (short)
- Two‑hand pattern (4-bar loop, 16th grid):
  - Left hand: root on 1.00 (full bar sustain), octave drop on 3.00 (optional), occasional syncopated root on 2.50.  
  - Right hand: chord stabs on 1.00, 1.75, 2.50, 3.25, 4.00 (use 16th-note lengths 1/16–1/8), vary inversion on bar 2. Velocity: 96–112 on downbeats, 82–96 on off‑stabs.  
- Bass: root on 1.00 (vel 112), passing 16th on 2.50 (vel 96), octave on 3.00 (vel 112). Sidechain to kick with 20–40% ducking.  
- Drums: Kick on each quarter; clap/snare on 2 & 4; closed hats on every 8th with open hat on 2.75 and 4.75; subtle 16th hat rolls with velocity variance ±10.

If you want, I can: (a) produce exact MIDI 16th‑note step sequences (per bar) with MIDI velocity numbers for a 4‑bar piano‑house loop, or (b) provide specific chord voicings in a given key (e.g., C minor or C major) with intervals and inversion positions. Which do you prefer?
