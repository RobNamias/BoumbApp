# 808 Bass Slide techniques

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
808 bass slides use **long-duration notes** (typically 1/4 or 1/2 bar) overlapping on 16th-note grid for glide/portamento effects, creating syncopation by landing slides on off-beats after snares (e.g., beat 2 and 4).[2][3][4]  
No swing applied; straight 16th-note timing with slides (80-120ms glide time) following drum bounce—first note sustains to snare hit, then slides to root note on pickup.[3][4]  
Patterns hum root notes from melody, e.g., G (16th=1.0) to C (slide over 4-8 16ths).[2][4]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Follows **root notes of melody/chord progression** in minor scales (e.g., C minor: C, Eb, G) common in drill/trap.[2][4]  
Slides move chromatically or diatonically (e.g., G to C up/down octave, or 2-octave drop on downbeat).[3][4]  
Pitch automation: dive 1-2 octaves over 30-50ms per note, staying in key.[3]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Bass (808)**: Long samples with pitch glide/portamento; pattern example (16th-note grid, 1 bar): Note1 (C3, hold 12/16ths, max vel), slide to Note2 (G2, hold 12/16ths); layer short kick for punch on sparse notes.[2][3][4]  
- **Kick**: Layered under long 808s for transient attack; short 1/8-note hits on beat 1, avoiding overlap with 808 sub.[2][5]  
- **Snare**: Short 808 snare/clap on beats 2/4 (1/8-note); robotic, punchy attack, no slide.[1]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Max velocity (127)** on emphasized 808 slides for sub punch, reduce to 80-100 on secondary notes for dynamics (lighter notes fade faster).[2][3]  
Range: 90-127 overall; automate per hit (full on downbeats, lower on pickups) to create tension/release without distortion.[2][3]
