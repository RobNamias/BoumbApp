### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Slap bass emphasizes **16th-note syncopation** with percussive thumb slaps (T) on lower strings mimicking kick drum (beats 1, 3) and index finger pops (P) on higher strings mimicking snare (beats 2, 4), often in 8th-note grooves like "We Will Rock You" pattern: T (kick) - P (snare).[1][5][6]  
Use muted thumb attacks (X) for ghost notes on offbeats (e.g., 16th-note upbeats: T-X-P-X per measure) to add funk groove; no swing, straight 16ths for precision.[5][6]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Root-focused on minor blues scales (e.g., **G minor blues**: G-Bb-C-Db-D-F) or one-chord vamps (root + octave).[1][5]  
Intervals: primarily perfect 5ths/octaves (e.g., root to 12th fret); incorporate hammer-ons/pull-offs on 3-notes-per-string patterns for legato runs across scales.[1][2]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Thumb slap (T) on E/A strings (lower 3rd/4th), downstroke near fretboard end for snare-like thump (16th-note attacks: beats 1 & 3).[1][3][5][6]  
- **Snare**: Index pop (P) on D/G strings (higher 1st/2nd), upward pull snapping against fretboard (beats 2 & 4).[1][3][6]  
- **Bass**: Electric bass guitar with low action (1/16" treble, 3/32" bass strings); palm-muted ghosts (X) intersperse for rhythm lock; active preamp optional for definition.[1][4]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Thumb slaps: high velocity (90-127) for sharp snap, precise wrist rotation; pops: medium-high (80-110) to match intensity without overpowering.[4][5]  
Muted attacks (X): low velocity (40-70) same force as sounded notes for even groove; full range 40-127, relax hand for control, avoid string bleed.[5][6]
