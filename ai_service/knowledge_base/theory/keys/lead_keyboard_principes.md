# Lead keyboard principes

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Lead keyboard patterns use **straight 16th-note divisions** in 4/4 time, prioritizing smooth voice leading over syncopation. No swing; maintain even quarter-note pulses with left-hand roots on beats 1 and 3. Right-hand chords follow chord changes on downbeats, using block or broken patterns (e.g., quarter-note arpeggios: root-3rd-5th-root).[1][3][4]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Diatonic major/minor scales (e.g., C major: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, intervals W-W-H-W-W-W-H). Chord symbols dictate harmony: triads (maj/min/dim), 7ths (dom7, maj7), tensions (9/11/13 in parens). Voice leading retains common tones (e.g., G between Cmaj and Gmaj), moves others minimally (stepwise or oblique).[1][2][3][5]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Emulate on left-hand octave roots (beats 1, 3); 8th-note pattern.
- **Snare**: Right-hand chord stabs on beats 2, 4 (quarter notes).
- **Bass**: Left-hand root-fifth octave (e.g., C-G-C on beat 1); inversions for close transitions (2nd inv C/G to 1st inv F/A).[4][5]
Right-hand: melody on top, 3rd-7th fills (shell voicing: root-melody-3rd-7th).[1][3]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**60-100 MIDI velocity** range: bass/kick at 80-100 (mf-f), snare/chord stabs at 70-90 (mf), melody notes 60-80 (mp-mf) for smooth phrasing. Peak single climax velocity at 100; decay legato lines to 60. Detached chords: 90+ with short release.[1][4][6]
