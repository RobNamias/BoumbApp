# Jazz ii-V-I Progression (C Major)

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
- **16th-note patterns**: Use swung 8th notes (long-short ratio 2:1) as base; subdivide into 16ths with off-beat emphasis on 2+ and 4+ for syncopation. Hi-hat on all 8ths (swing feel), ghost notes on snare 16ths (e.g., positions 2+, 4, 10+, 14).[3]
- **Kick/snare**: Kick on 1 and 3 (quarter notes, swung); snare backbeat on 2 and 4 with 16th-note fills (e.g., 9-12 on bar end for tension release).[1][2]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
- **Progression (C Major)**: Dm7 (ii: D-F-A-C) → G7 (V: G-B-D-F) → Cmaj7 (I: C-E-G-B); 2 bars each at 120-160 BPM, roots descend by fifths.[1][2][3][4][5]
- **Scales/intervals**:
  | Chord | Scale | Intervals (root up) |
  |-------|--------|---------------------|
  | Dm7  | D Dorian (C Maj scale from D: D-E-F-G-A-B-C) | 1-b3-5-b7 (whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half-whole) [3] |
  | G7   | G Mixolydian (C Maj from G: G-A-B-C-D-E-F) | 1-3-5-b7 (whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half) [3] |
  | Cmaj7| C Ionian (C-D-E-F-G-A-B) | 1-3-5-7 (whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half) [3] |

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Quarter notes on 1, 3; 8th-note walks on G7 (e.g., G-B-F-D 16ths).[1]
- **Snare**: Backbeat quarters on 2, 4; 16th-note brushes/ghosts (positions 5-8, 13-16) for swing groove.[3]
- **Bass**: Walking quarters/8ths following roots (Dm7: D-F-A-C; G7: G-B-D-F; Cmaj7: C-E-G-B); 16th-note fills on beats 4 (e.g., chromatic approach to next root).[2][4][6]
- **Piano/comping**: Block voicings (guide tones: Dm7 F-C; G7 B-F; Cmaj7 E-B); 8th-note comps on off-beats.[1][6]
- **Ride cymbal**: 8th-note swung pattern (accent 3+ every bar).[3]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
- **Overall**: 60-100 (mf to f); cresc. on G7 (75-95) for tension, decresc. on Cmaj7 (65-85) for resolution.[1][2]
- **By instrument**:
  | Instrument | Velocity Pattern (16ths, avg.) |
  |------------|-------------------------------|
  | Kick      | 90-110 (peaks on 1,3) [1]    |
  | Snare     | 70-100 (ghosts 50-70, backbeat 95-110) [3] |
  | Bass      | 75-95 (roots 90, walks 70-85) [2] |
  | Piano     | 65-90 (comp 60-80, chords 85-100) [6] |
  | Hi-hat/Ride | 55-75 (consistent swing) [3] |
