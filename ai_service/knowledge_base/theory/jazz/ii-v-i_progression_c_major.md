# ii-V-I Progression (C Major)

> Source: Perplexity Sonar | Batch Import | Category: theory/jazz

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
- **16th-note patterns**: Straight 16th-note comping on ii and I chords; syncopated 16th-note upbeats on V chord beats 2 and 4 for tension (e.g., 16th notes on "e-&-a" of beat 2).[1][3]
- **Swing**: 16th notes swung at 2:1 ratio (long-short); apply to walking bass (8th-note triplets feel) and ride cymbal pattern across progression.[1]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
- **Chords (C Major)**: ii = Dm7 (root D, intervals: 1-b3-5-b7 or D-F-A-C); V = G7 (root G, intervals: 1-3-5-b7 or G-B-D-F); I = Cmaj7 (root C, intervals: 1-3-5-7 or C-E-G-B).[2][3][5]
- **Scales**: ii (Dm7) - D Dorian (C Major scale starting on D: D-E-F-G-A-B-C); V (G7) - G Mixolydian (C Major scale starting on G: G-A-B-C-D-E-F); I (Cmaj7) - C Major/Ionian (C-D-E-F-G-A-B).[1][2]
- **One bar per chord** in 4/4 time; roots descend by fifths (D→G→C).[3]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Quarter notes on beats 1 and 3; add 16th-note anticipation before V chord beat 1.[1]
- **Snare**: Backbeat on 2 and 4; light ghost notes (16th notes) on upbeats during ii for groove.[1]
- **Bass**: Walking line in 8th notes swung as 16th-note pairs; ii: D-F-A-C → G; V: G-B-D-F → C; I: C-E-G-B → repeat (roots on beat 1, chord tones/arpeggios on offbeats).[3][5]
- **Piano/Comping**: Block voicings (root-3rd-7th-5th) in quarter-note stride on ii/I; 16th-note bebop shells on V.[1]
- **Drums overall**: Swing ride on hi-hat/ride cymbal (16th-note pattern).[1]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
- **ii (Dm7)**: 60-80 (mf- f); steady comping.[1]
- **V (G7)**: 80-100 (f- ff); peak tension with accents on tritone (B-F).[2][3]
- **I (Cmaj7)**: 50-70 (mp- mf); resolution decay.[1]
- **Overall range**: 50-100; bass/kick 70-90, snare ghosts 40-60, comping swells +10 on V.[1]
