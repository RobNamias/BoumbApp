# Minor Pentatonic Scale

The **minor pentatonic scale** is a five‑note scale (1, b3, 4, 5, b7) whose musical characteristics map directly onto common rhythmic, harmonic, instrumental and dynamic roles used in popular music and blues/rock contexts[4][5].  

Rhythm & Groove (16th‑note grid, syncopation, swing)
- Core feel: Lines built from the minor pentatonic commonly sit comfortably on an even 16th‑note grid but gain drive and “human” feel from syncopation (anticipations on the 16th before the beat) and small rhythmic displacements[6][3].[6]  
- Typical 16th‑note patterns:
  - Straight rock/blues riff: steady 1e&a subdivisions with accented downbeats (1 & 3) and occasional snare on 2 & 4. Use repeated 16th‑note patterns (e.g., 1e&a 2e&a repeated) to form riffs[3].[6]  
  - Syncopated lick: place scale tones on the “&” or the “e” (e.g., 1 & a of beat 2) to create forward motion; tie notes across the beat to blur metrical accents[6].[3]  
  - Swing feel: convert pairs of 16ths into long‑short triplet subdivisions (approx. 2:1 ratio) for a swung blues/gospel feel; minor pentatonic phrases often emphasize the b3 and b7 on the long note of the pair for phrasing[6].  
- Articulation cues for sequencing: use short staccato notes (10–40 ms release) for percussive riffs, and longer tied/legato durations (50–120 ms) with slide/bend automation for vocal‑like expressions common in solos[6].

Harmony & Scales (interval content and harmonic compatibility)
- Formula & intervals: 1, b3, 4, 5, b7 (root, minor third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, minor seventh)[4][5].[2]  
- Relation to parent scales: derived from the natural minor (Aeolian) by omitting 2 and 6; therefore it avoids semitone dissonances inherent in 7‑note scales and remains consonant over many chord types[4][1].  
- Functional compatibility:
  - Works over tonic minor chords (i–) and simple v or V7 dominant contexts; scale tones map to chord tones (1 = root, b3 = minor third, 5 = fifth, b7 can imply dominant flavor)[2][7].  
  - Because it omits 2 and 6, it is *safe* over many progressions staying in one key — less clash with chord extensions[1][5].  
  - Can be superimposed over related major chords for mixolydian/ambiguous modal color (common in blues/jazz usage)[5][7].  
- Voice‑leading: target chord tones (1, b3, 5) on strong beats; use 4 and b7 as passing/approach tones or for bluesy color (b7 particularly for dominant sounding lines)[4][2].

Typical Instruments & Patterns (roles broken down for sequencing)
- Electric guitar (lead/riffing):
  - Role: primary melodic/solo voice; plays boxed patterns, bends, slides, vibrato on scale degrees b3 and b7[6].  
  - Typical pattern: 16th‑note double‑stop or single‑note riff with accent on beat 1 and syncopation on the “&” of 2; include string‑bend automation on target notes (b3 → 4 or 5) for expressiveness[3][6].  
- Bass (electric/ synthesized):
  - Role: anchor root motion and outline chord/root + 5th; link riffs to groove with syncopated 16th‑note patterns and occasional passing notes from the pentatonic (4 or b7)[2].  
  - Typical pattern: root on downbeat, octave or 5th on the “&”, syncopated 16ths (e.g., rest on beat, play on “&” and “a”) to create pocket; use slides/gliss between root and 5th for blues style[2].  
- Drums (kick, snare, hi‑hat):
  - Kick: emphasize beats 1 and the “&” of 2 or 3 for drive; syncopated 16th kick patterns support bass syncopation (avoid constant 16th kick unless modern electronic style)[3].  
  - Snare: backbeat on 2 and 4 (hard accents); ghost snares on the “e” or “a” of beats for groove nuance in funk/blues contexts[3].  
  - Hi‑hat/ride: steady 8th or 16th subdivision; use open hi‑hat or swung 16ths for shuffle feel; add 16th‑note hi‑hat accents on “&”s to emphasize syncopation[3].  
- Rhythm guitar/keys:
  - Role: supply chordal bed — simple minor triads or power chords (root +5) on 1 and 3, or chord stabs on offbeats to accent syncopation; when comping, avoid adding 2/6 scale tones to maintain pentatonic clarity[1][4].  

Velocity / Dynamic Range for sequencing
- Performance mapping:
  - Lead guitar/melodic voice: velocity range high dynamics for expressivity — MIDI velocity ~80–127 (or 0.63–1.0 normalized) for main accents; use lower velocities 40–79 for passing notes and ghost notes to create phrasing[6].  
  - Bass: moderate to high velocities for primary root hits (70–110); slightly lower for passing 16ths (50–80) so they sit behind the kick[2].  
  - Kick & Snare: kick peaks higher (snappy attack) — MIDI velocities for acoustic kits: Kick 100–127 on primary downbeats, snare 110–127 on backbeats, ghost snares 40–70 on subdivisions[3].  
  - Hi‑hat/ride: lower velocities for constant 16ths to avoid masking (40–90); open hi‑hat/accents 90–120.  
- Dynamic contouring:
  - Use velocity layering plus automation (gain, saturation, filter cutoff) to simulate crescendos in solos — start phrases at medium velocity and peak on target bends/phrases[6].  
  - Maintain a dynamic headroom: keep typical ensemble peak around 85–95% of max to allow expressive transient boosts on accents.

Practical sequencing rules (quick checklist)
- Quantize melodic riffs to 16th grid but allow 10–40 ms humanization on selected notes to restore groove[6][3].  
- Place chord‑tone targets (1, b3, 5) on strong beats; use 4 and b7 as passing or bent target notes[4].  
- Program kick/bass interlocks: avoid simultaneous low‑frequency hits on every 16th — stagger bass notes on “&”s if the kick lands on downbeats[3].  
- Velocity mapping: lead accent velocities 80–127, passing notes 40–79; drums: kick/snare high, ghost hits low; hi‑hat lower and consistent[6][3].
