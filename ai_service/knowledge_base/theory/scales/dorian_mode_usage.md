# Dorian Mode usage

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Dorian mode usage lacks genre-specific rhythmic patterns; it appears across jazz, blues, rock, and pop without fixed syncopation or swing mandates[1][2][3].  
For sequencer implementation: Use straight 16th-note grids in 4/4 at 90-120 BPM for rock/metal riffs; apply 10-20% swing quantization for jazz/blues grooves emphasizing off-beat accents on beats 2 and 4[3].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Dorian scale**: Minor scale with raised 6th (intervals: 1, 2, ♭3, 4, 5, ♯6, ♭7); e.g., D Dorian = D E F G A B C[1][2][3][5].  
**Key chords**: i (minor), III (major), VII (major), IV (major); emphasize ♯6 and ♭3 in melodies via half-step tensions (2-♭3, ♯6-♭7)[1][6].  
Sequencer pattern: Arpeggiate i - III - VII - IV over 16th notes, targeting ♯6 on strong beats for modal color[1].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
No universal instrumentation; common in jazz (upbeat grooves), rock/metal (pentatonic riffs + ♯6), blues/funk[2][3].  
- **Kick**: 16th-note patterns on 1, 3, with syncopated 16ths (e.g., 1e, 3a) for drive[3].  
- **Snare**: Backbeat on 2 and 4; add ghost notes on 16th off-beats (e.g., 2e, 4a)[3].  
- **Bass**: Root-fifth-octave on quarter notes, walking 16ths targeting ♯6/♭7; e.g., in D Dorian: D-F-A-B (♯6)-C-D[3][6].  
Guitar/synth: Minor pentatonic riffs with ♯6 inserts on upbeats[3].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Range: 40-110 for introspective minor feel with hopeful lifts; low velocities (40-70) on ♭3/♭7 for melancholy, peaks (90-110) on ♯6 for brightness[1][2][4].  
Sequencer: Velocity curve rises on ♯6 arrivals (e.g., 16th-note melody: 60-80-100 pattern); humanize ±15 for groove[1].
