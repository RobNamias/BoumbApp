### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Phrygian mode lacks inherent rhythmic prescriptions; use straight 16th-note patterns in 4/4 time for tension, or apply light swing (10-20% shuffle) on 8th notes for flamenco/metal contexts[1][2]. Syncopation via off-beat 16th-note accents on b2 scale degree (e.g., beats 2+ and 4e in 16th grid) emphasizes exotic pull; avoid heavy swing to preserve modal dissonance[1][3].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Phrygian scale**: 1, ♭2, ♭3, 4, 5, ♭6, ♭7 (e.g., E Phrygian: E-F-G-A-B-C-D; intervals: m2, m2, M3, M2, m2, m2, M2)[1][2][5].  
**Key harmony**: i - ♭II - i (e.g., Em-F-Em); diatonic chords: i (m7), ♭II (Maj), ♭III (m), iv (m), V (dom7), ♭VI (Maj), ♭VII (m)[1][3][5]. Emphasize ♭2-root tension in melodies over 16th-note ostinatos.

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: 16th-note patterns on 1, 2+, 3, 4+ (syncopated); double-kicks on ♭2 beats for metal drive[2].
- **Snare**: Backbeat on 2 and 4; add 16th-note ghost notes on e/i for flamenco snap[1].
- **Bass**: Root-♭2 ostinato in 16th notes (e.g., E-F-E-F over i-♭II); octave jumps on downbeats, walking lines targeting ♭2 resolution[1][3].
Guitar riffs: Power chords on i and ♭II, 16th-note palm-muted chugs; leads trace scale with hammer-ons from ♭2[2][3].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Low-to-high range (20-127 MIDI); roots/kicks at 100-120 (forte), ♭2 accents at 110-127 (ff for tension), inner voices 60-90 (mf-pp for dissonance)[1][2]. Sudden peaks on ♭II resolution (115-127), sustains at 40-70 for ominous sustain; compress to 30-40dB dynamic span[3].
