The blues scale basics: a concise, sequencer‑friendly breakdown of rhythmic, scalar, instrumental, and dynamic characteristics for programming or notation.

1) Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)  
- Core feel: Blues commonly uses a swung‑8th or shuffle subdivision where straight 16th/8th grid is interpreted with uneven pairings (first note longer, second shorter), producing a long‑short long‑short feel applicable at the 16th‑note level by delaying the off‑beat 16ths (swing ≈ triplet feel) [1][2].  
- Syncopation: Accents commonly fall on the backbeat (snare on 2 and 4) and on off‑beat 16ths (the “&” and “a” of a 1e&a subdivision) to create call‑and‑response phrasing and push/pull groove [1].  
- Shuffle conversion for 16ths: Represent a shuffle by mapping each pair of 16ths to a triplet subdivision where the first 16th ≈ two triplet subdivisions and the second ≈ one triplet subdivision; this preserves swing when using a 16th grid[1][2].  
- Typical tempo ranges and feel: Blues tempos vary widely; program swing articulation and slight timing micro‑offsets (5–35 ms) on off‑beats to emulate human feel and blue‑note timing[1][2].

2) Harmony & Scales  
- Primary blues scales (formulas): Minor blues scale = 1, ♭3, 4, ♭5, 5, ♭7 (hexatonic); Major blues scale = 1, 2, ♭3, 3, 5, 6 (hexatonic) [2][6].  
- Blue notes and microtonality: Emphasize the ♭3 and ♭5 (or ♯4) as “blue notes” that may be played slightly microtonally or bent so they sit between diatonic pitches for authentic color[2].  
- Usage over harmony: Minor blues scale is most common for soloing over dominant or major blues progressions; players often use one blues scale over entire 12‑bar changes (scale tied to key rather than each chord) [2][5].  
- Chord context: Classic blues progressions use I7–IV7–V7 (dominant 7th) harmony; the interaction of major 3rd in chord and minor/blues ♭3 in the scale creates characteristic tension [4].  
- Variants: Hexatonic (6‑note), octatonic/expanded and even nonatonic (9‑note chromatic inflections) forms exist for more chromatic/jazz approaches[3][2].

3) Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)  
- Drum role (programming cues):  
  - Kick: Often plays a steady pulse with simple syncopated accents on 1 and the “&” of 2 or the “a” of 3 to lock with bass; avoid overly dense 16th kick patterns—use spare, groove‑supporting placements to leave space for swing/shuffle feel[1].  
  - Snare: Backbeat on 2 and 4 is primary; add ghost 16th snare taps (very low velocity) on off‑beats for shuffle articulation and human feel[1].  
  - Hi‑hat/ride: Use swung 8th/16th pattern (shuffle) — program as alternating long/short 16ths or map to triplet subdivisions; open hats or ride accents on “&” provide forward motion[1][2].  
- Bass role and patterns:  
  - Typical bass pattern: Walking bass (quarter notes with chromatic approach notes) in jazz/blues contexts or a repetitive two‑bar riff emphasizing root–fifth–flat‑7 movements for traditional blues; syncopate on off‑beats to lock with kick[1][4].  
  - 16th‑note usage: Use sparse 16th fills (lead‑ins) and anticipate chord changes by placing chromatic approach 16ths on the “&” or “a” subdivisions[3][5].  
- Guitar/lead roles: Electric/acoustic guitar and harmonica commonly carry riffs and fills; use bends, slides, and microtonal inflections on blue notes; comping typically uses dominant 7th voicings with rhythmic chops on 16th off‑beats (percussive muted strums) [1][4].

4) Velocity / Dynamic Range (for sequencing)  
- Overall dynamic window: Blues performance typically spans a moderate dynamic range; set MIDI velocity mapping to a useful expressive band (approx. MIDI 40–110) to preserve headroom and allow accents[1].  
- Relative velocities:  
  - Primary backbeats (snare on 2/4): medium‑high velocity (e.g., MIDI 88–110) to anchor groove.  
  - Kick pulses: medium (MIDI 70–95) adjustable to taste and vintage sound.  
  - Ghost notes/ghost snares: low velocity (MIDI 20–45) for subtle shuffle articulation[1].  
  - Bass notes: stable medium velocity (MIDI 70–100) with occasional accented approach notes at higher velocity (MIDI 95–120) to emphasize movement.  
  - Guitar comping: mixed velocities—percussive chops lower (MIDI 50–80), single‑note fills/hits higher (MIDI 90–120) and bends expressed by pitch‑bend and velocity modulation rather than only velocity.  
- Expressive control: Combine velocity with slight timing offsets and subtle humanization of velocity (±5–12 units) plus pitch‑bend for blue‑note microtones to simulate authentic phrasing[2][6].

If you want, I can export specific 16th‑note grid examples (MIDI tick positions and velocities) for: a) 12‑bar slow shuffle, b) mid‑tempo Chicago blues, or c) walking‑bass jazz‑blues — tell me tempo (BPM) and DAW tick resolution and I’ll produce exact event lists.
