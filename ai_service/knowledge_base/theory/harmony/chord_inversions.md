# Chord Inversions

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Chord inversions do not define specific **rhythmic patterns**, syncopation, or swing; they are harmonic rearrangements applied within any groove. Use straight 16th-note grids or sequencer-default swing (e.g., 50-60% for subtle feel). Bass lines follow inversion bass notes on beats 1 and 3 (quarter notes), with offbeat 16th-note fills for tension release[1][2].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Chord inversions rearrange triad notes (root position: root-3rd-5th; **1st inversion**: 3rd-5th-root; **2nd inversion**: 5th-root-3rd) within any scale (e.g., major: W-W-H-W-W-W-H intervals). Maintain scale identity; inversions create unstable intervals (e.g., 6th or 6/4 above bass) for voice leading. Sequence as: root → 1st inv (I⁶) → IV → V, cycling every 4 bars in C major scale[1][2][3].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Standard 4-on-the-floor (beats 1,2,3,4 in 4/4); no inversion-specific changes.
- **Snare**: Backbeat on 2 and 4; add 16th-note ghost notes post-inversion for tension.
- **Bass**: Lock to inversion bass note (e.g., C maj 1st inv: E on beat 1, octave up on & of 3); pattern: quarter-note root/3rd/5th arpeggio per bar, 8th-note walks between inversions for smooth voice leading[1][2][6].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Use mid-range velocities (60-90) for root position stability; reduce to **50-75** for 1st/2nd inversions to emphasize less stable, restless sound. Bass: 70-85; upper voices: 55-70 (softer 3rd/5th). Automate swells: low (50) on inversion entry, peak (85) on resolution[1][4][5].
