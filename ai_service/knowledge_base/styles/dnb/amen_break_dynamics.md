# Amen Break Dynamics

> Source: Perplexity Sonar | Batch Import | Category: styles/dnb

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Amen Break is a 4-bar drum pattern at ~120 BPM, grid-aligned to **16th notes** with heavy syncopation from displaced hits; no swing (straight timing with micro-delays for groove).

- **Bar 1-2** (standard funk): Kick on 1, "and" of 3 (doubled), 4; snare on 2, 4 (delayed 1/8 note on 4), ghost snare pickups on 16th before 3 and downbeat[3][2][5].
- **Bar 3**: Kick early (1 step before expected), snare delayed 2 16ths on 2/4, ghost note omitted[5][3].
- **Bar 4** (stumbling transition): Kick empty on 1, doubled unaccented/accented on "and" of 1 and 3-4; snare ghost notes on 16ths of 1-2, pickup before "and" of 1; crash on 11th 16th[3][5][2].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
No harmony or melodic content; pure drum break. Program over it using **minor pentatonic** (intervals: 0-3-5-7-10 semitones) or **mixolydian** (0-2-4-5-7-9-11) scales at matching root for jungle/drum & bass contexts[1].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Short beefy attack (early displacements in bars 3-4); pattern as above, often pitched down for hip-hop[3][5].
- **Snare**: Crunchy with ghost notes/pickups; delayed/accented on 2/4, rolls in chopped variants; 16th-subdivided ghosts before beats 3/downbeat[3][2][1].
- **Hi-hat/Ride**: Constant 16th-note ride (pauses on crash), open hats on off-beats for tumble[3][5].
- **Crash**: Single accent on bar 4, 11th 16th[5].
- **Bass**: Sub-heavy sine or distorted saw (40-60 Hz), locked to kick on 1/"and"3, syncopated 16ths following groove; layered under chopped breaks[1].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Wide range (40-127 MIDI velocity) for humanized feel: kicks 90-110 (punchy peaks), snares 70-120 (accents/ghosts: ghosts 40-60), hi-hats 50-80 (ride decay), crash 110-127. Micro-velocity variation (±5-10) per 16th for organic groove; EQ/boost lows/mids post-velocity[3][7].
