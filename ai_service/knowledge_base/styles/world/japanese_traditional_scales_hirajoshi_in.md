### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Japanese traditional music in Hirajoshi and In scales uses **straight 16th-note rhythms** with minimal syncopation or swing. Patterns emphasize even subdivision (e.g., 4/4 or 8/8 meter equivalents) at slow-to-moderate tempos (60-100 BPM); no off-beat accents on 16th-note upbeats; shakuhachi breath patterns imply subtle rubato, but sequencer: quantize to grid[1][2][5].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Hirajoshi scale**: Pentatonic with intervals **2-1-4-1-4 semitones** (e.g., in C: C-D-Eb-G-Ab; degrees: 1-2-b3-5-b6).  
**In scale**: Related hemitonic pentatonic (third/fourth mode overlap; e.g., C-D-F-G-Bb per variants); intervals 2-3-1-2-4 semitones. Harmony: static drones on root/5th; avoid triads—use open 4ths/5ths (e.g., 1-5 or b3-5); no voice leading, emphasize gapped melodies on scale tones[1][3][4].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Shakuhachi (lead melody)**: 16th-note phrases with long sustains on 1/b3/5; alternate high-low leaps (4-semitone jumps).
- **Koto (chords/arpeggios)**: Plucked 16th-note ostinatos in 2-1-4 patterns (e.g., root-2-b3 repeat); role: harmonic bed.
- **Shamisen (rhythm)**: Downstroke 8th-notes on beats 1/3.
- **Kick**: Sparse on beat 1 (velocity 80); 16th-note offbeat echoes optional.
- **Snare**: None traditional—use low taiko hits on 2/4 (8th-notes).
- **Bass**: Drone root on whole notes; 16th-note walks via 1-2-b3[1][2][4][5].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Wide range (20-127)** for expressivity: melodies 60-110 (crescendo on sustains); percussion 40-90 (soft attacks); drones 30-70 (pp-mf); automate swells on 4th-interval leaps for tension/release[1][2].
