### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Chinese pentatonic music emphasizes steady, stepwise melodic flow over complex syncopation or swing, derived from overtone series sequences without frequent tonal shifts.[2][4]  
In 16th-note grids: Use even 8th-note pulses (no swing); minimal off-beat accents—place hits on beats 1, 2.5, 3, 4 (e.g., 8 16ths: on/4 off/on/4 off/on/4 off/on).[1][2]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Chinese pentatonic scale** (Gong mode): Intervals from root—major 2nd (gōng-shāng), major 3rd (to jué), perf 5th (to zhǐ), min 7th (to yǔ); notes e.g., C-D-E-G-A (repeating cycle).[1][4][6]  
Modes shift starting note (e.g., Shang mode: D-E-G-A-C); single tonic focus, no modulation; stack in 5ths for harmony (3-4 note clusters).[2][4]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Steady 8th-notes or quarter-notes on beats 1/3 (16ths: every 4th 16th); low Gong root (e.g., C1).[2]  
- **Snare/Claps**: Sparse on 2/4 (16ths: 5th/13th positions); light woodblock emulation for groove.[1]  
- **Bass**: Pentatonic arpeggios (root-3rd-5th-2nd) in 8th-notes; follow melody (e.g., C-E-G-D pattern).[4][5]  
Traditional: Xiao flute (melody in pentatonic, even 16ths), guqin (arpeggiated bass).[4][5]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Narrow range for serene balance: 40-90 (pp to mf); melody peaks at 75-85, bass/kick 50-70, percussion 60-80.[5]  
Swell gradually over 4 bars (e.g., 50→85→50); avoid >90 or <40 for natural flow.[1][2]
