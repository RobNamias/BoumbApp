### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Middle Eastern Maqam music emphasizes **straight 16th-note rhythms** in sequencer adaptations, derived from traditional usul (metric cycles) like 4/4 or 10/8 samai patterns. No inherent swing; use even quantization. Syncopation via off-beat accents on beats 2 and 4 in 16th-note grids, creating forward drive through delayed melodic entries and percussive fills on 8th-note offbeats[1][5][6].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Hijaz scale** (e.g., on D): D - Eb (half) - F# (augmented 2nd jump) - G - A - Bb - C - D; microtonal bends on 2nd (sharper ascending, flatter descending) and 6th degrees; built from Hijaz jins (lower: 1-b2-3; upper: 4-5-b6-b7)[1][3][5].  
**Bayati scale** (e.g., on D): D - Eb↓ (quarter-flat) - F - G - A - Bb - C - D; microtonal 2nd degree (exact halfway between Eb and E); Bayati jins lower (1-b2-b3-4), often with secondary Hijaz jins on 4th degree for tension[1][2][3].  
Use heptatonic repeating at octave; sequencer approximation: equal temperament with pitch bends (+/-50 cents on b2, b6)[4][6].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: 16th-note pattern on beats 1, 2.5, 4 (low-pass filtered at 60-80Hz); doubles on 16ths for usul groove[5].
- **Snare/Clap**: Syncopated on 2, 4, and 16th offbeats (e.g., 1e&4e); rimshot velocity layers for texture.
- **Bass**: Root-fifth ostinato in 8th notes (e.g., Hijaz: D-G-D-G; Bayati: D-G-A-D); slides into b2 with 16th-note fills targeting scale tones 1-3-5.
- **Melody (Oud/Ney lead)**: 16th-note runs emphasizing jins phrases (Hijaz: b2-3 leap; Bayati: b2-b3 resolve); drone on tonic.
- **Perc (Darbuka/Riq)**: Triplet fills over 16ths on offbeats; frame drum 8th-note pulse[4][5].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Wide range 40-127 for expressivity: **melody/bass 70-110** (pp to mf, peaks on 3rd/5th scale degrees); **kick 90-120** (consistent mf-f); **snare 80-115** (accented syncopations); **perc fills 60-100** (p to mp). Automate swells (crescendo on jins resolution) and micro-decays for ornamentation feel[1][3].
