# Taiko Drum Patterns

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Taiko rhythms emphasize steady pulses on large drums (e.g., **ō-daiko** providing consistent quarter-note pulses) with complex overlays on mid-sized drums; smallest drums (e.g., **shime-daiko**) maintain busy 16th-note patterns like steady "tsu-tsu-tsu-tsu" or "don-tsu-don-tsu".[1][5][7]  
Patterns often use 8-beat cycles starting on beat 2 or 6 for syncopation (e.g., **don** on off-beats, **doko** as right-left 16th pairs); no swing—strictly straight timing at steady tempos with accelerando/ritardando transitions.[1][5][7]  
Basic strokes in 16ths: **don** (center hit, quarter or 8th), **doko/doro** (RL 8th pair), **tsu/tsuku** (edge rim, subdued 16th).[6][7]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
No harmony or scales—unpitched percussion only; pure rhythmic texture without melodic intervals or tonal centers.[1][5]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick/Bass (ō-daiko, nagadō-daiko)**: Large standing drums; steady pulse patterns like repeating quarter-note **don** (e.g., 16th grid: don--- --- ---, low boom).[1][5]  
- **Snare (shime-daiko, mid-sized)**: High-pitched; busy 16th-note rhythms (e.g., tsu-tsu-tsu-tsu or doko-doko on 8ths); jiuchi base (steady 8th groove) or uwa-byōshi overlays (e.g., don-tsuku-doko-tsu).[1][5][7]  
- **Other (small taiko)**: Rim/edge 16ths for fills (tsuku-ka); all played with **bachi** sticks in unison layers.[2][6]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Wide range: low velocities (50-70) for tsu/tsuku rims/subdued; mid (80-100) for doko pulses; high (110-127) for don/ō-daiko booms; use crescendos (gradual 60→127 over 8-16 beats) and diminuendos for builds.[1][5]
