# Gamelan Rhythm Patterns

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Gamelan rhythms are cyclical, structured in **colotomic** phrases that begin and end with a large gong stroke, subdivided by layered instruments where larger ones play slower pulses and smaller ones faster subdivisions.[1][5] No inherent swing or Western syncopation; instead, interlocking patterns (*polos* and *sangsih*) create dense, precise grooves at varying **irama** levels (note density relativity), cued by **kendhang** drum for tempo changes.[3][5] In 16th-note sequencer terms: core cycle = 8-32 beats (e.g., balungan skeleton: 2-3-2-1 on beats 1-2-3-4); bonang panerus doubles to 16ths (232.232.); kendhang on offbeats for groove lock.[3]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Slendro** (5-note scale, nearly equal intervals: short/medium steps approximating 240¢ each) and **pelog** (7-note scale, uneven intervals, non-Western pitches).[2][3][4] Core **balungan** melody (skeletal notes) elaborated in cycles; no functional harmony, but layered cyclic melodies within 2-octave range (e.g., slendro: 1-2-3-5-6).[1][3] Sequencer mapping: Slendro intervals ≈ [240,240,240,240,240]¢ from root; pelog ≈ [140,200,110,320,160,270]¢ (varies by ensemble temperament).[2][3]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
No kick/snare/bass; map to gamelan roles for sequencer:
- **Gong** (kick equivalent): Single hit on cycle start/end (e.g., beat 1 every 8/16/32 beats), low rumble.[1][5]
- **Kendhang** (snare equivalent): Hand drum cues tempo/irama on 8th/16th offbeats, variable patterns for groove shifts.[2][4]
- **Bonang barung/panerus** (bass/mid): Interlocking 8th/16th patterns doubling balungan (e.g., barung: 2-3-2-.; panerus: 232.-232.); mid-low gongs.[3]
- **Balungan instruments** (bassline): Core melody on quarter notes (e.g., 2321 cycle).[1][3]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Sudden shifts: Start **forte/ff** (velocity 100-127), decay to **piano** (40-70) by phrase end, abrupt reset to loud.[1] Sequencer: Layered cresc/decresc per irama (soft: 50-80 vel; loud: 90-127 vel); kendhang peaks at 110-127 for cues.[1][4]
