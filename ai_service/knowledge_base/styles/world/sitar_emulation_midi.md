# Sitar Emulation MIDI

> Source: Perplexity Sonar | Batch Import | Category: styles/world

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Sitar emulation MIDI uses straight 16th-note patterns with no swing or syncopation, emulating the lead voice's polyphonic note tracking and selectable decay speed on single notes or chords[1][3][5]. Sympathetic string drones sustain continuously without rhythmic variation, reacting dynamically to lead notes for a steady groove[1][6].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Scales include major, minor, and exotic modes (e.g., custom sympathetic drones tuned to sitar ragas via selectable keys)[1][3]. Intervals emphasize wide tonal ranges with polyphonic lead voice (root, 3rd, 5th triads) and tunable sympathetic drones for harmonic resonance[1][5].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
No kick, snare, or bass; primary instrument is **sitar-emulated lead** (16th-note single-note lines or chords with decay envelope: attack on note-on, exponential decay over 0.5-2s)[1][4]. **Sympathetic drones** (sustained MIDI notes on chord tones, velocity-triggered volume swells) provide background resonance[1][5]. Patterns: Lead on channel 1 (melodic 16ths), drones on channel 2 (held whole notes).

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Velocity range 40-120: low (40-70) for subtle plucks with short decay; high (90-120) for aggressive attacks with long decay and drone swells[1][6]. Dynamics via expression (MIDI CC1 for lead decay time, CC11 for drone volume); polyphonic response tracks note velocity for organic variation[5].
