### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Deep Drum and Bass operates at **170–174 BPM** with rolling, understated grooves using sparse, detailed drum programming.[1][6]  
- **16th-note patterns**: Rolling breaks with layered funk-style breaks sped up; hi-hats add texture on 16th-note offbeats; minimal syncopation via ghost notes on 16th-note upbeats for subtle swing feel (10-20% swing quantization).[1][2]  
- Kick-syncs tightly to bass on beats 1 and 3; snares/breaks emphasize 2 and 4 with sparse fills; negative space prioritizes restraint over dense syncopation.[1][2]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Deep sub-bass scales** dominate: minor pentatonic or Aeolian modes (intervals: 1-b3-4-5-b7) in low octaves (C1-G1 range), often legato (smooth, connected 8th/16th notes without gaps).[1][2][3]  
- Extended chords/pads use jazz-inspired harmony (e.g., 9th/11th voicings in minor keys); sub-bass fundamentals at 20-60 Hz with harmonic mids.[1][3]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Punchy, low (50-100 Hz), on beats 1/3; 16th-note variations sparse, syncing sub-bass for cohesion.[2][5]  
- **Snare**: Sharp, cutting hits on 2/4; layered with breaks for rolling 16th-note fills (e.g., 8th-note triplets into 16ths).[1][2]  
- **Bass**: Weighty sub-bass (sine/808-style, 20-100 Hz) rolling legato on 8th/16th notes; Reese-style (detuned saw layers, low-pass filtered); mid-bass harmonics for definition; patterns follow minor scale roots with octave jumps.[1][2][3][5]  
Sparse percussion/hi-hats (16th-note opens/closes) fill grooves.[1]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Restrained range (40-110 velocity)** emphasizes minimalist precision and negative space.[1]  
- Kick/bass: Consistent 90-110 (high for impact).  
- Snare/breaks: 70-100 (punchy peaks).  
- Hi-hats/perc: 40-80 (sparse lows for texture/movement).[1][2]
