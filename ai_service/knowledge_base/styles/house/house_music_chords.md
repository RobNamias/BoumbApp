# House Music Chords

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
House music uses a strict **four-on-the-floor** kick pattern (kick on every quarter note in 4/4 time, 120-130 BPM) with no swing; rhythms are quantized straight.[1][2][3]  
Syncopation occurs via **16th-note hi-hats** on offbeats (e.g., beats 2 and 4 of each 16th subdivision), open hi-hats on 8th-note offbeats, claps/snares on 2 and 4, and percussive rolls for momentum.[2][3]  
Chords and basslines add subtle syncopation by offsetting attacks to 16th-note positions between kick peaks.[6]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Minor scales** (e.g., F minor) dominate for moody feel, with diatonic chords mixing minor/major (e.g., i, III, v).[4][5]  
**Major scales** (e.g., C major, E major) for uplifting tracks.[1]  
Core progressions: I-V-vi-IV or I-vi-IV-V, using **7th/9th extensions** (e.g., min7, maj7, add9) for jazz flavor; play as block chords or arpeggiated in 8th/16th notes.[1][3][4][5][6][8]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: 4-on-the-floor (every quarter note); 16th-note pattern: kick on 1,5,9,13 of 16ths; deep 808/909 tone locking with bass.[2][3][4]  
- **Snare/Clap**: On beats 2 and 4 (8ths: positions 9,13 of 16ths); occasional 16th-note fills.[2][3]  
- **Bass**: Groovy 16th-note lines (e.g., offbeat emphasis on 5,9,13, interacting with kick); root-fifth-octave patterns or melodic fills in minor scale.[2][3][6]  
- **Chords**: Piano/synth pads in 7th/9th voicings; 8th-note blocks or 16th-note arpeggios (up/down), sidechained to kick.[1][3][5]  
- **Hi-hats**: Closed 16th-notes (all 16 positions, velocity varied); open on 8th offbeats (4,12).[3]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Low dynamic range** overall for hypnotic groove: 60-100 MIDI velocity.[3]  
Kick: 100-127 (consistent punch).  
Snare/Clap: 90-110.  
Hi-hats: 40-80 (16ths: low-med-low-high pattern for subtle syncopation).  
Bass/Chords: 70-100 (slight swells via automation, no extremes).[2][3]
