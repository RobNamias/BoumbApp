# Acid Bassline

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Acid basslines use **16th-note patterns** with rhythmic variation via gate length changes and off-beat accents for syncopation[1][4][6]. Apply subtle **swing** on 8th/16th-note divisions to create groove, avoiding straight quantization[2]. Typical sequence: continuous 16th-note plucks with alternating short/long gates (e.g., 50-80% note length) and filter accents on beats 2 and 4 for propulsion[1][6].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Monophonic lines in **Phrygian mode** (intervals: 1-b2-b3-4-5-b6-b7, e.g., E Phrygian: E-F-G#-A-B-C-D) or minor pentatonic with octave jumps and 5th intervals[2]. Notes slide via continuous frequency acceleration ("accelerate" pattern), staying within 1-2 octaves, emphasizing root, b2, b3, 5th[2].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Bass**: Roland TB-303 emulation (square wave primary, sawtooth optional); 16th-note sequence with resonance >50%, cutoff sweeps (200-900 Hz), distortion; patterns vary every 8-16 bars (e.g., ascending slides, staccato plucks)[1][5][6].
- **Kick**: Four-on-the-floor 4/4 pulse at 120-130 BPM, steady 16th-note off-beats optional[3].
- **Snare**: On beats 2 and 4, short decay; hi-hats/claps on 8th/16th off-beats for drive[3].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Accents via filter envelope (velocity 80-127 peaks) create dynamic swells; base velocity 60-90 for plucks, with 20-40% variation per 16th note[1][6]. Low-end: 40-60 (subtle groove); high-end: 110-127 (filter resonance peaks); compress to 10-20 dB range for punch without overpowering[1].
