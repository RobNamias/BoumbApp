### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Classic Acidcore uses straight 16th-note patterns at 160-190+ BPM in 4/4 time, with no swing. Relentless four-on-the-floor kick pattern drives the groove; off-beat hats and clattering rides add syncopation via 16th-note placements on beats 2 and 4 off-subdivisions[2][1][4].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Minor-key scales (e.g., natural minor: intervals 1-½-1-1-½-1-1-1) underpin terse synth stabs and hypnotic TB-303 sequences. Focus on repetitive 16th-note basslines with filter modulation (cutoff/resonance sweeps); minimal harmony, prioritizing texture over chord progressions[2][1][6].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Heavily overdriven 909/808-style on every beat (four-on-the-floor), serving as bass foundation; 16th-note distortion tails for aggression[2][3].
- **Snare**: Sparse, off-beat claps/909 snares on beats 2/4; 16th-note hi-hats/ride patterns with grit[2][1].
- **Bass**: TB-303 sequences in 16th notes; short, resonant patterns with accent/slide/octave variations, high resonance/low cutoff for squelch[1][2][6].
Additional: Gritty percussion layers in 16th-note fills[2].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Narrow range (60-110 MIDI velocity) for relentless drive; kicks at 90-110 (sustained high), hats/stabs at 70-90 with subtle accents (100+ on 303 slides). Minimal variation emphasizes hypnotic repetition over peaks/troughs[2][1][3].
