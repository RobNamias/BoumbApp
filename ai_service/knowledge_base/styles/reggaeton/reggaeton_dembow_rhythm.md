### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Reggaeton Dembow rhythm is a two-bar loop at 85–100 BPM, based on a **3+3+2 cross-rhythm** (tresillo pattern) over four-on-the-floor kicks.[1][2][4]  
In 16th-note grid:  
- Bar 1: Kick on 1, Snare/Clap on 16th 4.3 (after three 16ths), Kick on 8, Snare/Clap on 16th 12.3 (after three 16ths).  
- Bar 2: Kick on 1, Snare/Clap on 16th 4.1 (after two 16ths + one 16th delay), Kick on 8, Snare/Clap on 16th 12.1 (after two 16ths + one 16th delay).[1][2][4]  
**Syncopation**: Heavy on off-beats (half-beats, every other 16th with slight delay for bounce); no swing (straight 16ths).[1][2]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Simple harmony supports rhythm; no specific scales defined—use minor pentatonic or Phrygian dominant (e.g., E Phrygian: E F G# A B) for tension over root bass.[1] Intervals: Root-fifth-octave progressions (i-VI or i-iv).[3]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: On beats 1 and 3 (quarter notes, four-on-the-floor base); low 808-style, sustained.[1][2][3]  
- **Snare/Clap**: Syncopated per 3+3+2 (16ths: 4.3, 12.3 bar 1; 4.1, 12.1 bar 2); sharp, mid-range.[1][2][4]  
- **Bass**: Roots on kick hits (1,3); sub-808 following kick rhythm, occasional slides.[1][3]  
- **Hi-hats**: Straight 16ths or 8ths, open on upbeats for groove; velocity variation.[1]  
- **Percussion**: Shakers/tambourine on 8ths; congas on tresillo for layer.[1][4]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Narrow range for dance groove: Kick 100–127 (peak), Snare/Clap 90–110 (consistent punch), Hi-hats 60–90 (subtle motion), Bass 95–120 (steady drive).[1] Low velocities (40–70) on fills for space; overall compressed dynamics (max 127, min 50) to prioritize rhythm lock-in.[2]
