### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Dembow rhythm is a **two-bar, 16th-note-based loop** at 120-140 BPM, structured as four-on-the-floor kicks with a **3+3+2 cross-rhythm** on snares for syncopation on every other half-beat (e.g., kicks on 1, 2, 3, 4; snares on 2&, 4& with delay on alternate upbeats).[1][2][3]  
In 16th-note grid:  
- Bar 1: Kick (1, 2, 3, 4), Snare (2.5, 4.5).  
- Bar 2: Kick (1, 2, 3, 4), Snare (1.5, 3.5 with slight delay for bounce).[2][3][4]  
**No swing**; straight 16ths with ghost notes (random 16th fills on snares) for live feel and variation.[3]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Minimalist harmony** using simple root-to-fifth basslines or single-note jumps between octaves/root-fifth in **major/minor pentatonic scales** (e.g., C major pentatonic: C-D-E-G-A intervals: W+W+1.5W+1.5W+W).[3]  
No complex chords; focus on repetitive scalar motion over the rhythm (e.g., C to G or C to C octave).[1][3]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: Four-on-the-floor (16ths: 1,2,3,4 every bar); punchy, low-passed in variations.[3][4]  
- **Snare/Clap**: Syncopated on half-beats (2&,4& bar1; 1&,3& bar2); short/tight (1-3kHz emphasis, no tail); ghost notes as random 16th fills.[2][3]  
- **Bass**: Distorted/synth, root-fifth 16th-note pattern synced to kicks (e.g., root on 1,3; fifth on 2,4); jumps octaves.[1][3]  
Other: Drum machines, synthesizers for hooks; vary groove to hi-pass kick/snare in choruses.[1][3]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**High energy, narrow range**: Kicks 100-127 (punchy peaks); snares/claps 90-120 (snappy, consistent); ghosts 60-80; bass 80-110 (sustained drive).[3]  
Full mix peaks at 110-127 for relentless groove; dropouts/ghosts create 40-60 lows for variation.[3]
