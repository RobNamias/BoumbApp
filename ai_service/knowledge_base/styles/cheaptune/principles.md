### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
- **16th-note patterns**: Straight 16th-note divisions on offbeats for propulsion; strong beats on 1 and 3, weak on 2 and 4[3][4].
- **Syncopation**: Accents on offbeats (e.g., 16th-note upbeats before beats 2 and 4) to create tension; no swing (straight quantization at 120-140 BPM)[3][4].
- **Groove**: Four-on-the-floor base with syncopated hi-hat opens on 16th-note & of beat 3[4].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
- **Scales**: Minor scale (natural minor intervals: W-H-W-W-H-W-W); occasional harmonic minor raise on 7th for tension[1][3].
- **Harmony**: Power chords (root-fifth intervals, e.g., parallel fifths at octaves); limited triads, unison lines; consonant minor tonality[1][5].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: 4-on-the-floor (beats 1,2,3,4 every bar, 16th-note grid); velocity peak at 100-127[4].
- **Snare**: Backbeat on 2 and 4; 16th-note ghost notes on & of 3 for fill[4].
- **Bass**: Root-note octave follows kick (e.g., 8th-notes synced to kick, minor scale roots); sliding 16th-note approaches to chord tones[5].
- **Other**: Hi-hats (open 8th-notes with 16th-note closes); synth leads (unison minor scale melody)[1][5].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
- **Range**: 60-127 (MIDI scale); kicks/snares peak 110-127, ghosts 60-80, hi-hats 70-90, bass/synths 80-110[1].
- **Patterns**: Terraced dynamics (verse: 70-100 avg; chorus: 100-127 peaks); no continuous swells[1].
