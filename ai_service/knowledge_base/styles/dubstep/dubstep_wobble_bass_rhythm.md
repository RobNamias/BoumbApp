# Dubstep Wobble Bass Rhythm

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Dubstep wobble bass rhythms use **half-time feel** (140 BPM tempo mapped to 70 BPM groove) with sparse 16th-note patterns. Kick on beats 1 and 3 (off-beat "lazy" placement for swing); snare/rimshot on beat 3 and off-beats (e.g., 16th notes at positions 4.3, 12.3 in 4/4 bar). **Swing**: 10-20% applied to hi-hats and kicks via velocity variation (e.g., 80-110 velocity on off-beat kicks); LFO on bass syncs to **8th-note triplets** or 16th notes for wobble syncopation[1][2][3].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
**Scales**: Minor pentatonic or Phrygian dominant (e.g., F# minor: F#-G#-A-B-C#-D# intervals: 1-b2-3-4-5-b6). Wobble bass holds single low notes (e.g., F#1 sub-bass) with LFO modulation; no complex chord progressions—focus on root-fifth octaves in sub-range (20-60 Hz)[1][4][5].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: 16th-note grid—hits at 0, 8, 12 (half-time emphasis); short decay, 40-60 Hz tuning[2].
- **Snare/Rimshot**: Beat 3 (position 8) + off-beats (4.3, 12.3 on 16ths); layered with reverb for space[1][2].
- **Bass (Wobble)**: Synth (saw/square waves + sub-sine); LFO modulates **low-pass filter cutoff** (rate: 1/8T or 1/16 notes, sine/triangle wave, 50-100% depth) + optional amplitude; pattern: sustained 1-2 bar notes with formant shifts via XY modulation; mid-range growl (200-500 Hz) over clean sub[2][3][4].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Drums: 70-127 range—kicks 90-110 (swing variation), snares 100-127 peaks, hi-hats 60-90 (open 110+). Wobble bass: 100-127 sustained, with LFO volume dips to 70-90 for pump; drops build 80→127 over 4-8 bars[2][3].
