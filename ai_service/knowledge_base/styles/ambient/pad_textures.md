# Pad Textures

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Pad textures use **whole-note or sustained half-note holds** (no 16th-note divisions). No syncopation or swing; rhythms are **straight and legato** with zero rhythmic movement to avoid competing with leads or percussion[1][2][3][5][6].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Pads follow **track chords** (e.g., major/minor triads or 7ths) on root-position voicings. Common scales: **diatonic major/minor** (intervals: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half) or modal (e.g., Dorian: whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half, whole). Hold single notes or 3-4 note chords without arpeggiation[3][6].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Pad (primary)**: Synth layers (saw/square waves for harmonics); hold chords across 4-8 bars with LFO modulation on filter/pitch for subtle movement.
- **Kick/Snare**: Absent in pad layer; pads sit behind percussion (no overlap).
- **Bass**: Absent; pads occupy mid-high range (200-2000 Hz) to complement sub-bass[1][2][3][6].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
**Low velocity range**: 20-60 (soft, consistent sustain). ADSR: Attack 800ms-2s (slow fade-in), Decay 2-4s, Sustain 0dB (full), Release 2-4s (long tail). No velocity layering; prioritize even dynamics for background wash[1][3][5].
