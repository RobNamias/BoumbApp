# Trap Hi-Hats Rolls

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Trap hi-hat rolls primarily use **16th-note and 32nd-note subdivisions**, accelerating into triplets (three notes per beat) for off-kilter feel, with rolls doubling/tripling speed (e.g., 1/32 or 1/64 notes) to accentuate pulses like pre-snare or phrase ends[1][2][3].  
**Syncopation** via offbeat placements and strategic rolls creates tension/release; **swing** (10-20% groove template) shifts 16th-note upbeats later to fit triplet context over straight duple beats[1][4].

### 2. Harmony & Scales
No specific scales or harmony define trap hi-hat rolls; they function rhythmically without melodic content, often pitch-modulated (rising/falling semitones) during rolls for texture via cutoff/resonance automation[1][3][4].

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Hi-Hats (focus)**: Closed hats on 16th-note triplets/rolls (e.g., rapid 32nd-note bursts panned L/R); open hats sparse for variation; stack 2+ layers with time-shift groove[1][2][3][4].  
- **Kick**: Deep 808 on beat 1 and syncopated offbeats (e.g., 1/8-note delay); supports hi-hat rolls without overlap[3].  
- **Snare**: Offbeat placement (beats 2/4 with ghost notes); rolls lead into snare for transition[1][2][3].  
- **Bass**: 808 sub-bass slides (minor 3rd-5th intervals) locked to kick, low-pass filtered to avoid hi-hat frequency clash[3].

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Velocity ranges **40-127** (MIDI scale); rolls use **crescendo** (low 40-60 start, peak 110-127 end) for natural build/momentum; ghost notes at 30-50, main hits 80-100; automate for lasery effect via resonance[2][3][4].
