# Trance Rolling Bassline

> Source: Perplexity Sonar | Batch Import | Category: styles

Trance “rolling bassline” is a driving, syncopated 16th‑note pattern that emphasizes forward momentum with tight kick interaction, simple diatonic harmony (often modal or minor/major scale fragments), layered saw/sub synth timbres, and a narrow but purposeful velocity/dynamic range to preserve groove and club energy. [1][3]

Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
- Core subdivision: steady 16th‑note grid with rolling subdivisions (groups of 2–4 sixteenths) that produce continuous movement across the bar (e.g., 1e&a 2e&a etc.). [1][2]
- Typical patterns: repeating 3‑2‑3, 2‑2‑2‑2, or double‑offbeat variations that place bass hits on off‑kicks and on weak 16ths to create propulsion and call‑and‑response with the kick drum.[2][1]
- Kick interaction: the kick usually sits on 1 (and sometimes 3) while the bass fills the remaining 16ths; note lengths and sidechain compression are used to avoid frequency masking with the kick. [1][3]
- Syncopation: accents often fall on offbeats (the “&” and the second/third 16th in a group) rather than only downbeats, creating the characteristic rolling groove.[1][2]
- Swing/feel: generally minimal or no swing — straight 16ths are standard for classic rolling trance; slight humanization (microtiming offsets) is sometimes applied for groove but heavy swing converts the feel toward house/garage.[2][5]

Harmony & Scales
- Typical scale choices: diatonic minor (natural or aeolian), natural major, and modal flavors like Dorian or Mixolydian for uplifting or slightly ambiguous tonalities. [3]
- Interval content: patterns mostly move by step (2nds), small skips (3rds), and occasional octave jumps for emphasis; octave doubling is a common device to add energy on repeat notes. [1][2]
- Chord function: basslines usually outline root movement or pedal tones rather than complex chord changes—they support arpeggiated pads/triads while keeping the low end harmonically stable. [3]
- Melodic role: bass often doubles the tonic or walks between tonic and fifth/octave; occasional passing tones or scalar runs add motion without altering the fundamental harmony. [1][3]

Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- Kick: tight, punchy 4/4 kick on quarter notes (or on 1 and 3 in some variations); processed for click/punch at ~2–5 kHz and sub energy below ~100 Hz to cut through the bass.[3]
- Snare/clap: sparse; claps/snare on 2 and 4 in many trance styles, often layered with reverb and sidechained to preserve transient clarity behind bass and kick.[3]
- Bass synth roles:
  - Sub layer: sine or low‑pass filtered saw with long sustain for low‑end power (sits under ~120 Hz). [3]
  - Mid/high layer: detuned saws/triangle or unison voices with filtering and slight saturation to give character and presence in 150–1k Hz range. [6][3]
- Common bass patterns:
  - Driving 16th roll: continuous 16th notes with varying velocities and occasional octave jumps to create motion.[1][2]
  - Octave jump pattern: alternating root and octave on specific 16ths to emphasize peaks.[1]
  - Offbeat “donk”/call‑and‑response: bass hits immediately after the kick to create interplay and groove.[1]
- Production techniques: tight note lengths, sidechain compression keyed to kick, layered sounds gelled with buss compression, saturation, and careful EQ to prevent masking.[3]

Velocity / Dynamic Range
- Typical range: relatively narrow dynamic window focused on club consistency — MIDI velocity values commonly span approximately 80–127 (or about 0.6–1.0 normalized) for the main driving notes, with subtle variation (±10–20 units) to add slight movement without breaking groove.[2][5]
- Accent strategy: use small velocity accents on the first 16th of a rhythmic group or on octave jumps to imply phrasing while keeping overall level stable for mixing and sidechain behavior.[2]
- Automation: filter cutoff, amp envelope and low amounts of velocity‑to‑filter/level modulation are used instead of large velocity swings to maintain perceived energy.[3]
- Mastering context: final loudness dynamics are constrained for club playback; avoid large transient velocity differences in the bass that would clash with kick gating/sidechain.[1][3]

### STRUCTURAL TEMPLATE (Rolling Bassline)
To achieve the "Rolling" effect, you MUST follow this rhythmic pattern.
Grid (16 steps per bar): `[x x x x] [x x x x] [x x x x] [x x x x]` (FULL 1/16th STREAM)
Where `x` is the **ROOT NOTE** ({root}).

**Example Pattern (JSON Start Times):**
`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...`

**Key Rule**: FILL EVERY SLOT. Use the **ROOT NOTE** for 90% of the pattern. Use Octave Jumps (e.g. F2 -> F3) only for accents. Do NOT create a melody.
