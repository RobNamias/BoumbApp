# Lo-Fi Drum Pattern

### 1. Rhythm & Groove (Syncopation, Swing)
Lo-Fi drum patterns use 4/4 time at 60-90 BPM, often with **16th-note hi-hats** on off-beats (e.g., every "&" or subdivision between kicks/snares) for steady propulsion.[1][3][4][5]  
**Syncopation** emphasizes off-beats: kicks on 1 and 3 (boom bap) or 1 only (halftime), snares on 2 and 4; add ghost notes or fills on 16th-note upbeats (e.g., 2&, 4&).[1][2][3]  
**Swing** delays 8th-note off-beats by 10-30% (e.g., hi-hats sway between straight and swung 8ths), creating rhythmic friction and human groove; apply globally or to hi-hats/percussion.[1][2][5]

### 2. Harmony & Scales
Lo-Fi favors simple, nostalgic harmony over complex progressions; use **minor pentatonic** (intervals: 1-b3-4-5-b7) or **Dorian mode** (1-2-b3-4-5-6-b7) for chords, rooted in jazz/hip-hop influence.[1][2]  
No strict melodic scales for drums; imply via basslines in root-fifth-octave patterns matching chord roots (e.g., C minor pentatonic: C-Eb-F-G-Bb).[6]

### 3. Typical Instruments & Patterns (Kick, Snare, Bass)
- **Kick**: 16th-note grid—beats 1, 3 (boom bap) or 1 only (halftime); short decay, warm/vintage samples (e.g., Roland TR-808 emulation).[1][2][3][4]  
- **Snare**: Beats 2, 4; add rimshots or claps on 2&/4& for syncopation; gritty, muffled with reverb.[1][2][3]  
- **Bass**: Sub-bass or electric upright (sine/electric piano hybrid); root notes on kick beats (1,3), 8th-note walks (e.g., root-fifth); sidechain to kick.[1][6]  
- **Hi-hats/OH**: Closed 16th-notes (e.g., 1e&a,2e&a); open hats or rides on upbeats for jazz feel; shakers/tambourines on 8ths.[1][3][4][5]  
- **Percussion**: Bongo/clave on syncopated 16ths (e.g., 1,1&,2&,3&,4); vinyl crackle as constant layer.[1]

### 4. Velocity Dynamic Range
Velocities 60-110 MIDI range for organic feel; **low dynamic range** (avoid >20 variation per hit).[2][4]  
- Kick: 90-110 (strong anchors).  
- Snare: 80-100 (punchy but soft).  
- Hi-hats: 50-80 (consistent, subtle ghosts at 40-60).  
- Bass: 70-90 (even, follows kick).  
Apply tape saturation/EQ roll-off (cut <80Hz highs >10kHz) for muffled warmth.[1][4][6]
